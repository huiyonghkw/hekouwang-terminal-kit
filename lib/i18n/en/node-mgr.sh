hekouwang-terminal-kit — pick / switch the Node version manager

Usage:
  ./node-mgr.sh                 show which one is active
  ./node-mgr.sh fnm             switch to fnm (recommended, default)
  ./node-mgr.sh nvm             switch to nvm
  ./node-mgr.sh brew            switch to Homebrew node (single version, not a version manager)
  ./node-mgr.sh vfox            switch to vfox (version-fox)
  ./node-mgr.sh --lang zh       run in Chinese

Rule: keep exactly one. Mixing fnm / nvm / brew node / vfox makes PATH fight
itself and version switches stop sticking. The choice lives under
~/.config/hekouwang-terminal/; ~/.zshrc only sources that one snippet.
