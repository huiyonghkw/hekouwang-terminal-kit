hekouwang-terminal-kit — multi-machine sync / config drift / pinned-state migrate

Usage:
  ./sync.sh                        check: is what is deployed still identical to the repo (read-only)
  ./sync.sh --pull                 redeploy from the repo, pulling drifted files back into line
  ./sync.sh --export <path>        build a package you can carry to a second machine (whole tree)
  ./sync.sh --state-export [file]  export pinned state (theme / auto / node / optical / scene / badge)
  ./sync.sh --state-import <file>  restore pinned state on a new machine from the manifest
  ./sync.sh --lang zh              run in Chinese

The problem it solves: you hand-edited the Ghostty config on machine A, machine B is
still on the old config, and six months later you have no idea which one is right.
This makes "where did it drift" something you can see in one line.

For "what did I pin" across machines use --state-export / --state-import;
--export still packs the whole kit.
