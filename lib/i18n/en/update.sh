hekouwang-terminal-kit — update to the latest version

Usage:
  ./update.sh              pull updates → regenerate themes → redeploy the current theme
  ./update.sh --check      only show whether there is a new version and what changed
  ./update.sh --lang zh    run in Chinese

Why this exists: "updating" used to mean someone posts a new zip, you download and
reinstall it by hand, and you never really know whether you are on the latest version
or what changed. This script answers both.

It does not touch your ~/.zshrc.local or GUI settings you changed yourself; it only
regenerates the theme files and redeploys the theme you are currently using.
