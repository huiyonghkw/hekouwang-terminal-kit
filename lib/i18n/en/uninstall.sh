hekouwang-terminal-kit — uninstall / restore

Usage:
  ./uninstall.sh              interactive: asks item by item, removes only this kit's files
  ./uninstall.sh --dry-run    print what it would do, write nothing
  ./uninstall.sh --yes        no questions, run the default set (keeps brew packages and oh-my-zsh)
  ./uninstall.sh --lang zh    run in Chinese

Design rules (this file and install.sh are a pair — never change just one):
  1. Only removes what this kit installed. Homebrew itself, oh-my-zsh, your
     ~/.zshrc.local and your own git config are left alone unless you say otherwise.
  2. ~/.zshrc is restored from the timestamped .bak install.sh left behind, not deleted.
     If no backup is found it says so instead of pretending it worked.
  3. iTerm2 GUI settings are reset with defaults delete, back to iTerm2's own factory
     defaults — not to values we think are sensible (that would just be more meddling).
  4. It prints the list before removing anything; --dry-run prints the very same list.
