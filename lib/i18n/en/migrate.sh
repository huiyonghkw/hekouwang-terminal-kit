hekouwang-terminal-kit — adopt your existing .zshrc instead of overwriting it

Usage:
  ./migrate.sh              show the report first, decide afterwards
  ./migrate.sh --apply      do it (still makes a backup first)
  ./migrate.sh --lang zh    run in Chinese

Why this exists: install.sh replaces ~/.zshrc with a template. That is fine on a new
Mac, but if you have used yours for years — aliases, PATH entries, work env vars —
replacing it loses all of that at once (there is a .bak, but you would have to fish
every line back out by hand).

What this script does: it moves the lines that are *yours* into ~/.zshrc.local and
drops the lines the template provides anyway (oh-my-zsh init, starship, the fzf /
zoxide / atuin init lines, plugin sourcing), because the template gives you those
back in a better order.

It errs on the safe side: anything ambiguous counts as yours. The template sources
~/.zshrc.local at the end, so nothing of yours goes missing.
